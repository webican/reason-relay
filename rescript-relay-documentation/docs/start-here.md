RescriptRelay is a way to use [Relay](https://relay.dev), a JavaScript client-side framework for building data-driven applications using GraphQL, together with [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/). This page will briefly introduce the documentation, how it's structured and what to expect.

## Structure

The documentation is roughly divided into 3 parts:

##### 1. A walkthrough setting up RescriptRelay and introducing the main features

Each page in the walkthrough will introduce a concept from Relay and explain how to achieve the same thing in RescriptRelay. Each page will also have a section of _recommended background reading_ that you're encouraged to look into if you're not familiar with the concepts explained.

##### 2. An API reference covering the full RescriptRelay API surface

This will detail all modules, functions and concepts of RescriptRelay in good, old plain table form.

##### 3. Guides, tips and tricks

Here you'll find resources for making life with RescriptRelay easier.

## The next step

Ok, enough introduction! Let's move on to [getting started](getting-started) and start setting up RescriptRelay in your project.
